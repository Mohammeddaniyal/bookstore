Lombok is a Java library designed to reduce boilerplate code by generating commonly used methods automatically through annotations at compile time. It integrates with your IDE and build tools via annotation processing, so you write less repetitive code and keep your classes clean and readable.

Here’s a deeper explanation of Lombok and its most common annotations:

### What is Lombok?
- Lombok uses annotations to generate code like getters, setters, constructors, equals, hashCode, toString, and builders automatically.
- This **reduces the need to manually write repetitive code** in Java domain classes (like your User entity).
- Lombok works during compilation by modifying bytecode or generating source code.
- Requires your IDE to enable annotation processing and have the Lombok plugin installed to avoid compile-time errors or missing methods in the editor.

### Most Commonly Used Lombok Annotations (with deeper details):

| Annotation             | Purpose & Behavior                                                                                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **@Getter**            | Generates getter methods for all fields (or you can place on individual fields).                        |
| **@Setter**            | Generates setter methods similarly. Useful for mutable classes.                                        |
| **@ToString**          | Generates a `toString()` method including all fields by default; you can exclude sensitive or large fields. |
| **@EqualsAndHashCode** | Generates `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on fields; can exclude/transient fields for equality logic. |
| **@NoArgsConstructor** | Generates a no-argument constructor (required for JPA entities).                                       |
| **@AllArgsConstructor** | Generates constructor with all member fields as parameters.                                           |
| **@RequiredArgsConstructor** | Generates a constructor for final fields and fields annotated with `@NonNull`.                      |
| **@Data**               | A shortcut combining `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`. Suitable for simple POJOs. |
| **@Builder**            | Implements the builder pattern for flexible, readable object creation with chained methods.           |
| **@Value**              | Immutable variant of `@Data`—makes fields final, generates constructor, but no setters.                |

### Detailed Insights

- **@Getter and @Setter**:  
  Instead of writing:

  ```java
  public String getUsername() { return username; }
  public void setUsername(String username) { this.username = username; }
  ```

  Lombok generates these for you automatically, simplifying your entity or model class.

- **@NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor**:  
  Many frameworks, especially JPA/Hibernate, require a no-argument constructor for entity instantiation via reflection, so `@NoArgsConstructor` helps avoid writing one manually.  
  `@AllArgsConstructor` helps create instances with all fields set, useful for testing or convenience.

- **@Data**:  
  This is a powerful one-stop annotation that bundles several other annotations. It’s great for simple data carrier classes but can be too heavy if you want careful control over serialization or behavior.

- **@Builder**:  
  Particularly useful when you have classes with many fields or optional parameters. Instead of a long constructor call, you get readable code like:

  ```java
  User user = User.builder()
                  .username("daniyal")
                  .email("daniyal@example.com")
                  .password("secret")
                  .roles(List.of("ADMIN"))
                  .build();
  ```

- **Avoid Lombok pitfalls** by:
    - Always enabling annotation processing in your IDE.
    - Be aware of potential conflicts in equals/hashCode and lazy-loaded entities, especially in JPA.
    - Use exclusion parameters to stop sensitive fields from appearing in `toString` (e.g., passwords).

### Summary

Lombok is a productivity booster for Java developers, especially in Spring Boot projects, where domain entities and DTOs often have many boilerplate getters/setters and constructors. Its annotations help produce cleaner, more maintainable code while the generated methods seamlessly integrate with your build and runtime.
