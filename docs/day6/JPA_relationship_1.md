## 1. Overview of JPA Hibernate Relationships

| Relationship Type    | Description                                          | Key Annotations                                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| One-to-One          | One entity references exactly one instance of another | `@OneToOne`, `@JoinColumn`                        |
| One-to-Many         | One entity relates to multiple instances of another | `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`, `mappedBy` |
| Many-to-One         | Multiple entities relate to single entity           | `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`                       |
| Many-to-Many        | Multiple instances relate to multiple instances     | `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinTable`                        |
| Bidirectional       | Both entities reference each other                   | `mappedBy` used on one side                        |
| Unidirectional      | Only one entity references the other                 | No `mappedBy`                                     |

## 2. One-to-One Relationship

### 2.1 Concept

- One instance of Entity A is associated with exactly one instance of Entity B.
- Database-wise: Foreign key column links one table to exactly one row in another.

### 2.2 Annotations

- `@OneToOne`
- `@JoinColumn` (to specify the foreign key column on owner side)
- `cascade` (optional, for cascading operations)

### 2.3 Example in Java and MySQL Schema

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
    private Address address;
}

@Entity
public class Address {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
    private User user;
}
```

**MySQL tables created:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Address (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE User (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    address_id BIGINT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES Address(id)
);
```

**Sample inserts:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Address (id) VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO User (id, address_id) VALUES (10, 1);
```

### 2.4 Owning Side & `@JoinColumn`

- **Owning side** has the foreign key column (`User` owns the relationship in the example).
- `@JoinColumn(name = "address_id")` creates a foreign key column `address_id` in the `User` table, linking to the `Address` table primary key.
- The **non-owning side** uses `mappedBy` to indicate it does not own the relationship.
- The foreign key stores only the primary key of the related `Address`, not all fields.

### 2.5 Cascade Explanation

- `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` lets JPA cascade operations (persist, merge, remove, etc.) from parent to child.
- In example, when saving `User`, the `Address` is automatically saved too.

## 3. Bidirectional Relationships and `mappedBy`

### 3.1 Importance of `mappedBy`

- Prevents duplicate foreign key columns or join tables when both entities reference each other.
- Defines which side owns the relationship and manages the foreign key.
- The inverse side uses `mappedBy` pointing to the owning side's field.

### 3.2 Example: One-to-Many (Department & Employee)

```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department") // Inverse side
    private List employees;
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne // Owning side
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}
```

**Database schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id BIGINT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(id)
);
```

**Query to insert employees:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee (id, department_id) VALUES (10, 1), (11, 1);
```

### 3.3 What Happens Without `mappedBy`

- Hibernate thinks both sides own the relationship.
- May create **extra join tables or duplicate foreign keys**, causing redundancy.
- Breaks clean database design and leads to confusion and maintenance problems.

## 4. Many-to-One Relationship

### 4.1 Why `@ManyToOne` on Employee

- Represents that many employees belong to one department.
- Models natural database foreign key relationship (`department_id` in Employee table).

### 4.2 Duplicate FK Values and Meaning

- `@ManyToOne` allows **multiple rows in Employee to have the same `department_id`**.
- Enables many employees to associate with the same department (duplicates allowed).
- `@OneToOne` would constrain to unique foreign key values.

## 5. Role and Use of `@OneToMany` on Inverse Side

### 5.1 Purpose in Department Entity

- Enables **bidirectional navigation** from Department to Employee in Java.
- Makes it easy to get all employees of a department without manual queries.

### 5.2 Does it Create DB Columns?

- No, the collection `List employees` does **not create any column** in `Department`.
- It is just a Java representation of the inverse of the relationship managed by `Employee`.

### 5.3 Internal Queries Using `mappedBy`

- When accessing `department.getEmployees()`, JPA runs:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE department_id = :departmentId;
  ```

- This fetches all associated employees on demand (lazy fetching by default).

## 6. Use of `department.getEmployees()` in Code

### 6.1 Where to Use

- Used in **service layer or business logic** when you have a `Department` entity and want to retrieve its employees.
- Useful in APIs or when processing logic that involves fetching related employees.

### 6.2 What Happens Internally

- If `@OneToMany` default fetch is lazy, the employees list is a proxy until accessed.
- On calling `getEmployees()`, Hibernate triggers a SELECT query joining `Employee` to `Department` by `department_id`.

### 6.3 Example Usage

```java
@Service
public class DepartmentService {

    @Autowired
    private DepartmentRepository departmentRepository;

    public List getEmployeesByDepartmentId(Long departmentId) {
        Department department = departmentRepository.findById(departmentId)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Department not found"));
        return department.getEmployees(); // Triggers DB query if lazy
    }
}
```

## 7. Summary and Best Practices

| Concept                      | Explanation                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owning side                 | Entity that has foreign key column, manages relationship (`Employee` in `@ManyToOne`)  |
| `@JoinColumn`               | Defines FK column in owning sideâ€™s table                                              |
| `mappedBy`                  | Used on inverse side to reference owning side field, prevents redundant keys/tables   |
| Cascade                     | Propagates entity state changes from parent to child                                 |
| `@OneToMany` in inverse side | Enables bidirectional object navigation, no DB column created                         |
| Lazy fetching for collections | Collection loaded on first access, avoids unnecessary DB load                        |
| Repository methods          | `mappedBy` does NOT create repository queries automatically; explicit methods needed    |
| Bidirectional relationships| Keep relationship management clear to avoid schema redundancy and inconsistencies     |
