Absolutely! Here's a **structured explanation** of **Embeddable Classes** that you can save or use for future reference.

## 🧩 What Are Embeddable Classes in JPA (Spring + Hibernate)

### 🔹 Definition

An **Embeddable class** is a simple, reusable class whose fields are **embedded** into another entity's database table — instead of having its **own separate table**.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

To avoid creating separate tables for small value-type objects like:

* `Address`
* `Name`
* `Coordinates`
* `ContactInfo`

---

## 🧱 Key Annotations

| Annotation    | Use                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Embeddable` | Marks a class as embeddable — can be included in entities |
| `@Embedded`   | Used in an entity to embed the embeddable class           |

---

## 📦 Structure Example

### ✅ Embeddable Class

```java
@Embeddable
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String zip;
}
```

### ✅ Entity Class

```java
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @Embedded
    private Address address;
}
```

### 🧾 Result in Database

| id | name | street      | city        | zip   |
| -- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1  | John | 123 Main St | Springfield | 12345 |

> No separate `Address` table is created — all fields are in the `Person` table.

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

| Rule                               | Explanation                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| No `@Id` in `@Embeddable`          | Embeddable classes **don’t have their own ID** |
| No separate table                  | All fields are merged into the parent table    |
| Cannot be queried on their own     | You query the entity, not the embeddable class |
| Can be reused in multiple entities | Helps avoid code duplication                   |

---

## ✅ When to Use

Use `@Embeddable` when:

* You want to model a **value object** (no identity).
* The class only makes sense **as part of another entity**.
* You want to **reuse a set of fields** in multiple entities.

---

## 🧠 Summary (Your Words, Refined)

> When we use `@Embedded`, we tell Spring (and JPA):
> “Don't make a new table for this class. Just include its fields in the entity’s table.”
>
> Since it's not a real entity, we **don’t use `@Id`** or other entity-level annotations — because that would **break the embedding rules**.
