Certainly! Here is a **list of all the questions you asked from August 5 onward until today**, specifically related to your **Bookstore project and Spring Boot topics** within this conversation thread:

### Questions asked about Bookstore and Spring Boot (Aug 5 to today):

1. **How to implement and structure pagination controller for GET all books?**
2. **Explain the roles of Pageable and pagination in Spring Data and how controller handles it.**
3. **Details of how paginated response is returned and metadata included.**
4. **What is left to complete in the backend for the Bookstore app?**
5. **Explain relationships involved in the Order Management module before coding it.**
6. **Explain One-to-Many, Many-to-One, etc. relationships clearly and simply for the Bookstore entities.**
7. **Explain common JPA annotations used in entity relationships like @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn, etc.**
8. **How do @OneToMany, @ManyToOne annotations work internally with MySQL — i.e., foreign keys and tables?**
9. **Code and explanation for User ↔ Order relationship, how annotations control DB structure and queries.**
10. **How Hibernate generates SQL queries for saving and retrieving entities with relationships (especially User & Order).**
11. **Package/folder structure recommended for placing Order-related files (entities, DTOs, repositories, services).**
12. **Where to place enums like OrderStatus — entity package or separate "enums" package?**
13. **Explain `@ElementCollection(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` and how it maps collections of basic types (e.g., user roles).**
14. **How does the default join table naming work for ElementCollection — e.g., user_roles — and how fetch = EAGER affects querying?**
15. **Enumerate and clarify relationship mappings with explanation on why certain annotations are used (from User, Order, OrderItem, Book).**
16. **Deep dive on User to Order One-to-Many relationship, including ownership, mappedBy, foreign key column, and Hibernate behavior.**
17. **How Hibernate generates SQL queries from @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn, and @OneToMany annotations.**
18. **Explain with database table structure how User ↔ Order works practically.**
19. **Step-by-step explanation of how Hibernate creates tables and foreign keys with these annotations.**
20. **Detailed explanation of JPA entity mappings concepts — annotations, relationships, @JoinColumn, @JoinTable.**
21. **One-to-One relationship explanation with example and FK unique constraint visualization (Person ↔ Passport).**
22. **Clarification on usage of mappedBy attribute in @OneToOne and how it links owning/inverse sides.**
23. **Summarize all relationship structures and entity mapping best practices relevant to your Bookstore.**
24. **Why @OneToMany with cascade = CascadeType.ALL and orphanRemoval = true is used on Order → OrderItems collection.**
25. **Difference between cascade on entity relationships vs. implicit persistence with @ElementCollection collections.**
26. **Meaning of optional = false in @ManyToOne and its effect in enforcing non-null foreign keys.**
27. **How generated CREATE TABLE queries include NOT NULL constraints on FK columns with optional=false.**
28. **Can FK columns be nullable and implications of nullable FK without NOT NULL constraints.**
29. **Concept confirmation: all topics are clear now for JPA and Bookstore-related entity mappings and relationships.**

If you'd like, I can also categorize these questions by topic (e.g., Pagination, Entity Relationships, JPA annotations) or provide a summary of answers and next steps tailored to your project!

Just let me know how you’d like to proceed.
