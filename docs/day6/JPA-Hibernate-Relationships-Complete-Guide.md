## 1. Overview of JPA Hibernate Relationships

| Type             | Description                                  | Key Annotations                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| One-to-One       | One instance corresponds to exactly one other | `@OneToOne`, `@JoinColumn`                      |
| One-to-Many      | One entity relates to multiple others         | `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`, `mappedBy` |
| Many-to-One      | Multiple entities relate to one other          | `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`                     |
| Many-to-Many     | Multiple instances relate to multiple others   | `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinTable`, `mappedBy`         |
| Bidirectional    | Both sides reference each other                 | `mappedBy` attribute on inverse side            |
| Unidirectional   | Only one side has reference                      | No `mappedBy`                                    |

## 2. One-to-One Relationship

### 2.1 Concept

- One entity instance is related to exactly one instance of another entity.
- In database, usually represented by a foreign key unique constraint.

### 2.2 Annotations

- `@OneToOne` to declare the relationship.
- `@JoinColumn` on owning side to specify FK column.
- Cascade types may propagate operations.

### 2.3 Example

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "address_id") // FK column in User table
    private Address address;
}

@Entity
public class Address {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
    private User user;
}
```

### 2.4 Owning Side and `@JoinColumn`

- The owning side contains the foreign key column (here, `User`).
- `@JoinColumn(name = "address_id")` creates `address_id` in `User` table pointing to `Address.id`.
- Non-owning side (`Address`) uses `mappedBy` referring to the owner's field.

### 2.5 Cascade Behavior

- Cascade enables operations like save/delete to propagate to related entities.
- `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` means all operations cascade from `User` to `Address`.

## 3. Bidirectional Relationships and `mappedBy`

### 3.1 Purpose of `mappedBy`

- Defines inverse (non-owning) side in relationships.
- Tells JPA that FK is managed by owning side.
- Prevents duplicate FKs or join tables.

### 3.2 One-to-Many / Many-to-One Example

```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department") // Inverse side
    private List employees;
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id 
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne // Owning side
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}
```

- `Employee.department` owns the FK `department_id`.
- `Department.employees` is inverse, using `mappedBy`.

### 3.3 What Happens Without `mappedBy`

- Hibernate creates extra join tables or duplicate columns.
- Causes schema redundancies and can break relationships.

## 4. Many-to-One Relationship

### 4.1 Why `@ManyToOne`?

- Models that many entities can relate to one entity.
- FK stored at many-side entity.

### 4.2 Duplicate Foreign Keys Allowed

- `@ManyToOne` FK column (`department_id`) can have duplicates.
- Multiple employees can belong to the same department.

## 5. Role and Use of `@OneToMany` on the Inverse Side

### 5.1 Purpose of `@OneToMany` in Department

- Enables easy Java access to all employees of a department.
- Provides bidirectional navigation.

### 5.2 Does it Create DB Columns?

- No new DB column is created.
- Reverse navigation is purely a Java-side convenience.

### 5.3 Internal Queries and Navigation

- Accessing `department.getEmployees()` triggers query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE department_id = :departmentId;
```

## 6. Using `department.getEmployees()` in Java Code

### 6.1 Where and Why

- Use in service/business logic when you want employees of a department.
- Allows navigating parent → children entities.

### 6.2 Example in Service Layer

```java
@Service
public class DepartmentService {

    @Autowired
    private DepartmentRepository departmentRepository;

    public List getEmployeesByDepartmentId(Long departmentId) {
        Department department = departmentRepository.findById(departmentId)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Department not found"));
        return department.getEmployees(); // Lazy loads employees if configured
    }
}
```

## 7. Repository Methods and `mappedBy`

- `mappedBy` **does not** automatically create repository query methods.
- You need to define methods explicitly, e.g.:

```java
List findByDepartmentId(Long departmentId);
```

## 8. Many-to-Many Relationship

### 8.1 Concept

- Many instances of one entity relate to many instances of another.
- Implemented with join table to hold composite FK.

### 8.2 Annotations and Example

```java
@Entity
public class Course {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(
        name = "course_student",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
    )
    private Set students = new HashSet<>();
}

@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "students")
    private Set courses = new HashSet<>();
}
```

### 8.3 Join Table and Composite Key

- Separate table `course_student` holds `(course_id, student_id)` pairs.
- Composite primary key ensures unique pairs.

### 8.4 Collection Type Choice

- Use `Set` for uniqueness (commonly used).
- `List` or other collections allowed but may affect behavior.

### 8.5 Owning Side Selection

- Owning side defines `@JoinTable`.
- Inverse side uses `mappedBy`.
- Choice depends on your domain and usage.

## 9. What Value to Use for `mappedBy`

- The value is the **name of the field in the owning entity** that owns the relation.

Examples:

- **One-to-One**

```java
@OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")  // 'address' is field in owning entity User
```

- **One-to-Many / Many-to-One**

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")  // 'department' field in Employee owning side
```

- **Many-to-Many**

```java
@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "students")  // 'students' is field in owning entity Course
```

## 10. Summary and Best Practices

| Point                             | Details                                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owning side                      | Entity with FK column, uses `@JoinColumn`                    |
| Inverse side                    | Uses `mappedBy` pointing to owning side's field              |
| Cascade                         | Controls how operations propagate to related entities        |
| Collection on inverse side       | Convenience for bidirectional navigation, no DB columns      |
| Repository methods               | Must define explicitly, `mappedBy` does NOT auto-generate    |
| Lazy loading                    | Collections usually lazy; loaded on access                    |
| Many-to-Many                    | Uses join table with composite PK, owning side defines join  |
| `mappedBy` value                | Always refers to owning entity’s property name                |
