Absolutely! Below is a **deep, line-by-line explanation** of your `CustomUserDetailsService.java` so you understand not only “what” but “why” each line exists and how Spring Security integrates it internally.

# CustomUserDetailsService.java – Full Line-by-Line Explanation

```java
@Service
public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
```
- **`@Service`**
    - This annotation tells Spring that this class should be treated as a "service" bean—meaning it will be automatically discovered, instantiated, and managed by the Spring IoC container.
    - This lets you inject (`@Autowired`) this class wherever needed.

- **`implements UserDetailsService`**
    - You’re telling Spring Security:
      > “I will provide the logic for loading user details (like username/email, password, roles) from your user store (DB, memory, etc.)”
    - `UserDetailsService` is a contract from Spring Security consisting of a single method: `loadUserByUsername`.

```java
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;
```
- **`@Autowired`**
    - Spring injects an instance of your `UserRepository` here; you don’t need to construct it manually—Spring does this.
- **Purpose:**
    - This repository likely extends `JpaRepository` and provides CRUD access to your `User` table in the database.
    - You’ll use it to look up users by their email.

```java
    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String email) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
```
- **`@Override`**
    - You’re providing your own logic for the method declared by `UserDetailsService`.
- **`loadUserByUsername`**
    - Despite the method name, you’re using **email** as the identifier (perfectly okay as long as you use email as principal throughout your code).
    - Whenever Spring Security wants to authenticate a user (during login, or when validating a JWT token), it calls this method with the string you passed as username/email.
- **`throws UsernameNotFoundException`**
    - Signals to Spring Security that if no user is found with the given identifier, the authentication should fail immediately.

```java
        // Find the user by email
        User user = userRepository.findByEmail(email)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found with email: " + email));
```
- **Find user by email:**
    - You call your custom repository method (likely a `@Query` or derived query) that returns an `Optional` by email.
    - If the `Optional` is empty (user not found), you throw `UsernameNotFoundException`.
    - **Why is this important?**
        - Throwing this exception is the official way to let Spring Security know "there's no such user", resulting in a failed login or JWT check.

```java
        // Map the user's roles (String) to Spring Security's GrantedAuthority
        return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(
                user.getEmail(),        // the username for Spring Security (here, email)
                user.getPassword(),     // the hashed password
                user.getRoles().stream()
                    .map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)
                    .collect(Collectors.toList())  // convert roles to GrantedAuthority list
        );
```
- **`org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User`:**
    - This is NOT your entity—it's a simple implementation Spring Security uses to wrap user data for authentication.
    - It is an implementation of `UserDetails` and holds all info Spring Security cares about:
        - **Principal** (username/email)
        - **Password** (hashed)
        - **Authorities** (roles)

- **`user.getEmail()`**
    - This string is now the principal used everywhere in authentication (e.g., `Authentication.getName()` will return the user's email).

- **`user.getPassword()`**
    - This must be the hashed password (e.g., BCrypt) so Spring Security can (optionally) compare on password login.

- **Authorities Mapping:**
    - `user.getRoles()` likely returns a list/set of role names (`"ROLE_ADMIN"`, `"ROLE_USER"`, etc.).
    - Each role string is mapped to a `SimpleGrantedAuthority`, which is Spring Security’s official way to represent authorities and roles in the security context.
    - This list of `GrantedAuthority` (one per role) is what Spring Security uses to check if the user has access to `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` or similar methods.

- **Why not use raw strings?**
    - Spring Security compares roles/authorities at runtime only via the `GrantedAuthority` interface.

### Internal Flow and Relationships

- When you **log in** or a JWT is validated, Spring Security calls this method, passing the email you set as JWT subject (or submitted by user).
- If a user is found, this method returns a `UserDetails`. Now, Spring Security:
    - Can check passwords (on login),
    - Can check roles/authorities (for route/method access),
    - Knows who the user is via the “principal” (email).

- In **JWT authentication** (your case), the `JwtAuthFilter` calls `loadUserByUsername(email)` on every request with a token.
    - This ensures the latest roles are checked against the DB, and enables you to revoke users by removing them from the DB, changing their roles, or disabling the account.

## Recap Why Each Piece Matters:
| Line/Purpose                            | Why it’s needed                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| @Service                                | Registers as Spring Bean, auto-wired in config                   |
| implements UserDetailsService            | Integrates with Spring Security’s authentication infrastructure  |
| @Autowired UserRepository                | Provides data access to query user info                          |
| loadUserByUsername(String email)         | Standard entrypoint for Spring Security to load user data        |
| findByEmail(email)...orElseThrow(...)    | Ensures only real users are authenticated                        |
| new User(email, password, authorities)   | Wraps user data in a Spring Security-compatible object           |
| Role mapping via SimpleGrantedAuthority  | Allows role-/permission-based access control and checks          |

# Bottom Line for Low-Level/Internals Developers

- This service is **the bridge** between your user table and Spring Security's authentication and access control.
- It is run **every time** authentication happens (via login or JWT).
- Any bugs or mismatches here (username/email inconsistency, wrong roles) will cause authentication or authorization to fail.
- Good place to add extra checks: If you wanted to also ensure user is enabled, not locked, etc., implement those checks here by wrapping in a custom `UserDetails`.

If you want, I can now move on to the next core class (`SecurityConfig`), or clarify any part of this in even more detail! Just let me know.
