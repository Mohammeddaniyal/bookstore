Noted! I will remember to explain every part of the `CustomUserDetailsService` in detail at the end of today’s session as you requested.

Meanwhile, moving forward with the tasks, the next step is:

## Step: Implement CustomUserDetailsService (Brief Recap and Explanation)

You already have a concise implementation like this in your `security` package:

```java
@Service
public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String email) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        User user = userRepository.findByEmail(email)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found with email: " + email));

        return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(
            user.getEmail(),
            user.getPassword(),
            user.getRoles().stream()
                .map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)
                .collect(Collectors.toList())
        );
    }
}
```

### What this class does (summary):

- Implements Spring Security’s `UserDetailsService` interface.
- When Spring Security needs to authenticate a user, it calls `loadUserByUsername`.
- You fetch the user by email (or username) from your database (via JPA repository).
- If no user is found, it throws `UsernameNotFoundException`.
- If found, you build a Spring Security `UserDetails` object:
    - With user email (or username)
    - The hashed password
    - The roles converted into Spring Security `GrantedAuthority` objects.
- This `UserDetails` object is then used by Spring Security to check credentials and grant authorities.

### Why is this important?

- `CustomUserDetailsService` bridges your user data model with Spring Security’s authentication system.
- It lets Spring Security know what a "user" means in your system.
- It supports role-based permissions by translating your stored roles into authorities.

### Pending Explanation

At the **end of today’s session**, I will explain the key parts of this class step-by-step, such as:
- Why `UserDetailsService` is needed.
- The function and importance of `loadUserByUsername`.
- How roles and authorities are mapped.
- The meaning of throwing `UsernameNotFoundException`.

### Next Immediate Steps

After this, the natural progression will be:
- Create your Spring Security configuration class to wire this service, add the JWT filter, and secure your routes.
- Test authentication flows end-to-end.

Feel free to continue with anything else for now, and I’ll hold on to explain the full details on `CustomUserDetailsService` later as requested!
