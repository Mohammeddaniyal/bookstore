Certainly! Let me provide a **deep, line-by-line explanation** of the **authorized request scenario**, i.e., when a client makes a request to a **protected API endpoint including a valid JWT token**.

I'll clearly explain **which code executes, what is checked, how the security context is set, and how authorization is enforced**, referencing your classes and Spring Security core behavior.

# Authorized Request Scenario (Protected Endpoint with Valid JWT)

### Example request:

```
GET /api/books
Authorization: Bearer 
```

## Step 1: **HTTP Request Received by Spring DispatcherServlet**

- All requests come to **Spring’s DispatcherServlet**, which dispatches to the filter chain before hitting your controller.
- URL `/api/books` corresponds to a protected resource (requires `ADMIN` role in your SecurityConfig).

## Step 2: **Spring Security Filter Chain Starts Processing**

Your security filter chain is engaged on every request. Important lines in your `SecurityConfig`:

```java
.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .requestMatchers("/api/books/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    // other rules...
)
.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
```

- The entire filter chain processes the request; **your custom `JwtAuthFilter` runs before Spring’s `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.**

## Step 3: **JwtAuthFilter Executes**

The core logic is in your `JwtAuthFilter.doFilterInternal()` method:

```java
final String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");

String username = null;
String jwtToken = null;

if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    jwtToken = authHeader.substring(7);  // extract token (skip "Bearer ")
    username = jwtUtil.extractUsername(jwtToken);  // parse username (email) from token
}

if (username != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {
    UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);

    if (jwtUtil.validateToken(jwtToken, userDetails.getUsername())) {
        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken =
            new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());

        authToken.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));

        SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
    }
}

filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
```

### What happens here:

- **Read Authorization Header:**  
  The filter fetches the `Authorization` header and confirms it starts with `"Bearer "`.

- **Extract JWT Token:**  
  The JWT token string is extracted by removing the `"Bearer "` prefix.

- **Extract Username (Email) from JWT:**  
  Your `JwtUtil` parses the token, verifies signature integrity, and extracts the **subject** claim (your user’s email).

- **Check If Authentication Already Exists:**  
  Typically, `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()` is `null` at the start of the request because Spring does not store security contexts across HTTP requests in stateless APIs.

- **Load User Details:**  
  Invokes your `CustomUserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username)` to fetch the fresh user record (with hashed password and roles).

- **Validate the Token Against User Details:**  
  Uses `jwtUtil.validateToken(jwtToken, userDetails.getUsername())` to verify that:
    - The token is not expired,
    - The token’s subject equals the username in `UserDetails`,
    - The token signature is valid.

- **Create Authentication Token:**  
  Instantiates a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` containing:
    - The `UserDetails` principal,
    - No credentials (null) because user presented a valid JWT,
    - Granted authorities representing user roles.

- **Set Details:**  
  Adds extra web request details such as remote IP and session ID into the authentication token.

- **Set Authentication in SecurityContext:**  
  Sets the constructed `authToken` into Spring Security’s `SecurityContextHolder` for the current thread/request.

- **Continue Filter Chain:**  
  Passes control to the next filter or servlet in the chain after successful authentication setup.

## Step 4: **Spring Security Authorization Decision**

After the JWT filter sets authentication, Spring Security continues processing:

- Your request matches `/api/books/**`.
- The `SecurityConfig` says `.hasRole("ADMIN")` for this path.

### How is this enforced?

- Spring Security consults the current user’s authorities from the **`SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getAuthorities()`**.
- It checks whether this user holds the authority `"ROLE_ADMIN"` (Spring prepends `"ROLE_"` automatically when using `.hasRole()` checks).
- If yes → Access granted, request proceeds to your controller.
- If no → Spring Security throws **403 Forbidden** error before controller.

## Step 5: **Controller & Business Logic**

- Your controller method annotated with `@GetMapping("/api/books")` is invoked.
- Because authentication exists and user has proper authority, the method executes.
- Fetches and returns the requested book resources.

## If Token Is Invalid or Missing

- If the token is invalid (expired, signature wrong, or username mismatch during validation),  
  your `jwtUtil.validateToken(...)` call returns `false`.
- Your filter will **not set authentication** in the security context.
- Thus, the authentication remains `null`.
- Later during authorization, Spring Security blocks access:
    - Responds with **401 Unauthorized** if user is unauthenticated.
    - Or **403 Forbidden** if authenticated but lacks roles.

| Set Authentication          | `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken)` | User now authenticated for this request          |

| Controller executed or denied | Controller method runs or 403/401 returned       | Endpoint executed if authorized                    |

# Developer Takeaways

- **Your `JwtAuthFilter` is the key component that bridges raw JWTs and Spring Security’s authentication model.**
- Once the filter sets the authentication token in the context, Spring Security trusts the request as authenticated.
- **All access controls (role checks) rely on the `Authentication` and its GrantedAuthorities being properly set.**
- Failure to set the security context means all protected endpoints reject the request.
- The process runs **every request** because JWT-based security is stateless.

If you want, I can explain the exact internal workings of `SecurityContextHolder`, `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`, or how role prefixing `.hasRole(...)` works internally.

Would you like me to provide that? Or any code snippet explanations related to the flow?
