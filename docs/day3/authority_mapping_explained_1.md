Certainly! Let me clarify both approaches for creating a Spring Security UserDetails object and **why one might use the `.map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)` style versus `.roles(...)` with the builder**. I’ll explain each line and the core concepts behind the mapping step.

## 1. Using `.builder().roles(...)` Approach

```java
UserDetails userDetails = org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User.builder()
    .username(user.getUsername())    // 
);
```

**How it works:**
- Here, your code **converts each role string in your user entity** directly into a `SimpleGrantedAuthority` object.
- If your DB roles are already prefixed like `"ROLE_ADMIN"`, `"ROLE_CUSTOMER"`, mapping each to a `SimpleGrantedAuthority` *preserves the exact authority string without changes*.
- This lets you support:
    - Custom authorities/permissions (not just roles).
    - Already-prefixed role names.
    - Fine-grained access controls (e.g., `"ORDER_VIEW"`, `"PRODUCT_EDIT"`, etc.).

**When to use:**
- If your DB roles include `"ROLE_"` prefix already, or you mix permissions and roles, or you want more control.

## Why Use the `map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)` Style?

- **Spring Security checks all access via `GrantedAuthority` objects**, not plain strings.
- If you pass authorities using this mapping:
    - You’re giving Spring Security an explicit, flexible way to handle all role and permission types.
    - No magic prefixing: what you store in the DB is what gets checked.
    - It supports not just roles, but also more complex authorities if you want to introduce those.

**Example:**
If your entity stores `"ROLE_ADMIN"` and you use `.map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)`, the endpoint check `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` works because Spring automatically matches `"ROLE_ADMIN"`.

- If you use `.roles("ADMIN")` in the builder, Spring auto-prefixes and stores `"ROLE_ADMIN"` for you.

## Comparison Table

| Approach                   | DB Roles Syntax        | What Security Sees                   | Good for…                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| User.builder().roles(...)  | "ADMIN", "USER"       | "ROLE_ADMIN", "ROLE_USER"            | Simpler apps with plain roles |
| .map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new) | "ROLE_ADMIN"          | "ROLE_ADMIN"                         | Custom/advanced cases         |
|                            | "ORDER_EDIT"          | "ORDER_EDIT"                         | Permissions, not just roles   |

## Summary

- **Both methods are correct**, as long as your DB/store and your authorities-checking style match up.
- The `.roles(...)` builder does prefixing magic for you; the mapping style is more flexible/direct.
- **The map approach is more general and future-proof**—it supports any custom permission or naming convention (not just roles).

### Authority Mapping (Line by Line):
```java
user.getRoles().stream()                 // Take all roles (strings) assigned to this user
    .map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)    // For each, create a GrantedAuthority object
    .collect(Collectors.toList())        // Gather them into a List (what Spring expects)
```
- This is required because Spring only authorizes based on `GrantedAuthority` objects.
- It’s the bridge between your business model (plain strings) and the framework's access control.

**Bottom line:**  
Choose the approach that matches how your DB stores roles and how you want to check permissions.  
The mapping variant gives you more explicit control for complex scenarios.

If you still feel unsure, let me know how your roles are stored in your database, and I can recommend which approach to use in your case!
