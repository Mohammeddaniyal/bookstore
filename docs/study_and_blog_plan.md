# Study and Blog Plan

This file outlines my structured approach to learning, documenting, and sharing my Spring Boot project journey. It covers how I organize topics, setup guides, concept explanations, Q&A, reusable snippets, and blogging drafts for maximum clarity and reusability.

---

## 1. Topics Covered (`topics.md`)

- Acts as a concise index or table of contents for all concepts and tools encountered.
- Contains a simple bullet list of every topic, dependency, and key section learned.
- Examples:
    - Spring Boot Project Initialization
    - Gradle Dependency Management
    - Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
    - MySQL Database and User Setup
    - Lombok annotations usage
    - Testing with `@DataJpaTest`
    - DTO vs Entity discussion
    - Database relationships modeling

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Guides (`setup_guide.md` or `project_steps.md`)

- Clear, actionable instructions on how to replicate project setup and development steps.
- Ideal for future reference or onboarding others.
- Includes:
    - Project creation via Spring Initializr or CLI
    - Database and user creation commands in MySQL Shell
    - Configuration of `application.properties` or `application.yml`
    - Detailed file/package structure setup
    - Entity, repository, service, and controller creation
    - Running and testing the application

---

## 3. Concept Explanations (`concepts_explained.md` or per-topic files)

- In-depth explanations of each concept or tool.
- Explains annotation purpose, JPA relationships, Spring Security basics, etc.
- Helps build solid understanding beyond just code.
- Can be split into files per concept for easy search and reuse as blog posts.

---

## 4. Doubts and Solutions / Q&A (`faq.md` or `doubts_and_answers.md`)

- Records questions or issues encountered along with their clear solutions.
- Maintains a quick-reference FAQ for troubleshooting.
- Example entry:
    - **Q:** Why add `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = NONE)` in tests?
    - **A:** To prevent Spring Boot from replacing real DB connection with an embedded test DB.

---

## 5. Useful Code Snippets / Templates (`snippets.md` or `templates/` folder)

- Stores reusable code blocks for entities, repositories, configurations.
- Speeds up project development by quick copy-paste.
- Examples:
    - User entity template
    - JWT Security configuration snippet
    - Swagger API setup example

---

## 6. Blog Drafts / Articles (`blog_posts/`)

- Holds draft or completed articles to share knowledge publicly.
- Documents real problems, solutions, and learning moments.
- Acts as companion content to deep-dive concept explanations.

---

## 7. Project Retrospective / Learnings (`reflection.md` or `lessons_learned.md`)

- Narrative on what went well, challenges and surprises.
- Insights for future improvements.
- Helps consolidate learning and track personal growth.

---

## Additional Tips for Maintaining Great Notes

- Use Markdown format for easy readability and flexibility.
- Keep consistent and clear file/folder naming conventions.
- Link topics between files when useful, for example:  
  `[See role mapping explanation â†’ concepts_explained.md#elementcollection]`
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate.
- Update files regularly as you make progress or solve issues.

---

## Summary

This structure helps me:

- Stay organized and clear-headed during learning.
- Easily revisit any topic or solution.
- Prepare quality content for blogging.
- Share and onboard others with minimal hassle.
- Build deeper understanding alongside practical skills.
