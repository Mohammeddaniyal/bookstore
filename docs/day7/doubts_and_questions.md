1. **Entity Relationships and Mapping**
    - How to correctly define the relationship between Book and Author entities (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-One).
    - Best practices for handling cascading operations between books and authors.
    - How to avoid common pitfalls like infinite recursion in JSON serialization due to bidirectional relationships.

2. **Repository Layer**
    - How to design repository interfaces for basic CRUD operations on Book and Author entities.
    - Query methods for filtering or searching books/authors.

3. **Service Layer Implementation**
    - Structuring service methods to support creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving books and authors.
    - Handling validation and error scenarios in the service layer.

4. **REST API Design**
    - Which endpoints to expose for books and authors (e.g., `/api/books`, `/api/authors`).
    - How to secure these endpoints so only users with the `ADMIN` role can perform create, update, or delete operations.
    - How to handle public read access if required.

5. **Security Concerns**
    - Implementing role-based access control for book and author management.
    - Integrating these security rules with existing JWT and authentication setup.

6. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Validation**
    - When and how to use DTOs for requests and responses around book and author data.
    - Validating incoming data at the API boundary.

7. **Handling Exceptions**
    - Using global exception handlers to manage errors specific to book and author operations.
    - Returning meaningful error messages for CRUD operation failures or validation errors.

8. **Documentation and File Creation**
    - Documenting all these implementations clearly in a file to keep the project well-organized and maintainable.
