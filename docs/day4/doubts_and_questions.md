11. **Should we test service method directly or via controller?**
    - Compared unit-testing services versus end-to-end controller/integration testing.

12. **How to write a unit test for service step by step.**
    - Broke down each section—mocking repository, calling service, verifying behavior.

13. **Mockito/Byte Buddy agent warning meaning.**
    - Explained why you see the warning, what it means, and whether action is needed now.

14. **Is all this Spring testing really necessary vs just using Postman?**
    - Discussed pros and cons of automated integration tests versus manual API testing.

15. **How to manually create an admin user in user_roles table in MySQL.**
    - Proper way to assign ADMIN role by inserting into the join table.

16. **Does adding an admin role entry to the same user_id in user_roles work?**
    - Confirmed it does and explained relationship tables.

17. **Commonsense on using builder vs DTO mapping methods in service.**
    - Clarified the meaning of “map” in code, and why service layer is the place for DTO–entity conversion.
