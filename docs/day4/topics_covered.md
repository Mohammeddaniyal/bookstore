Alhamdulillah! Hereâ€™s a neat summary of **todayâ€™s topics covered** in your project work on the Book module â€” formatted like your daily documentation style:

# ðŸ“š Today's Topics Covered â€” Book Management & Service Testing (Day N)

### 1. **BookService `createBook` Method Implementation**
- Validated key business rules for creating books:
    - Checked for duplicate ISBN using `findByIsbn`.
    - Checked for duplicate `title + author` combination using `findByAuthorAndTitle`.
- Used the builder pattern to convert `BookRequestDTO` to `Book` entity.
- Returned a `BookResponseDTO` from the saved entity.
- Threw custom `BookAlreadyExistsException` with clear messages on duplicates.

### 2. **Validation & API Error Response Design**
- Reviewed use of validation annotations on DTOs to enforce input rules.
- Discussed error response patterns:
    - Detailed field-level validation errors returned as an error map (e.g., price, author, isbn).
    - Business logic errors (like duplicates) return a single clear `message` and `errorCode`, with an empty errors map.
- Ensured consistency between validation handling and business error reporting in API responses.

### 3. **Unit Testing Service Layer (Discussion & Planning)**
- Planned and explained how to write clean, maintainable unit tests for `BookService`.
- Explained mocking repositories to isolate service logic.
- Designed test cases for:
    - Successful book creation.
    - Duplicate ISBN and duplicate author+title scenarios throwing exceptions.
- Covered useful Mockito annotations and utilities (`@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, `when()`, `verify()`, etc.).

### 4. **Integration Testing Thoughts and Alternatives**
- Discussed the value of automated integration tests vs. manual testing with Postman.
- Agreed to proceed with manual testing via Postman for now and revisit automated tests progressively.
- Included practical testing steps with JWT and secured endpoints for the Book module.

### 5. **User & Admin Role Setup**
- Decided to manually create the initial admin user in the database for secure administration.
- Explained how roles are managed via separate `user_roles` table and how to assign `ADMIN` role properly.
- Confirmed best practice of linking user and roles using `user_id` and role entries.

### Next Steps (for Tomorrow InshaAllah):
- Implement the remaining service methods (update, delete, get) for the Book module.
- Create and secure the BookController to expose the CRUD REST API endpoints.
- Gradually add integration and unit tests for Book service + controller.
- Continue improving API error handling and security rules.

Feel free to ask if you want me to help prepare any code scaffolds, documentation snippets, or testing guides before tomorrowâ€™s session.  
Rest well and great progress today! ðŸš€âœ¨
