Alhamdulillah! Here‚Äôs a summary of today's progress and topics covered in your project:

# üìö Today's Topics ‚Äî Book Module Implementation & Testing

### 1. **Update Book Implementation**
- Implemented the `updateBook` service method with:
    - Checking if the book exists before updating.
    - Validating uniqueness for ISBN and (author + title).
    - Throwing exceptions on duplicates and missing resources.
    - Mapping updated fields and persisting changes.
    - Handling `null` return from save by raising a persistence exception.

### 2. **Immutable Fields**
- Decided to treat ISBN as immutable:
    - Documented that clients cannot change ISBN.
    - Enforced immutability by checking in service and rejecting updates with an exception.
- Discussed when and why to make fields immutable in applications.

### 3. **Partial Update (PATCH) Support**
- Created a `BookUpdateDTO` for partial updates with optional fields and no strict validation.
- Implemented a PATCH API endpoint for updating subsets of book data.
- Explained how to selectively update only provided fields while preserving others.
- Verified behavior when JSON has fields not in DTO (ignored by Jackson by default).
- Confirmed immutability of ISBN is preserved by excluding it from partial update DTO.

### 4. **Full Update (PUT) Support**
- Implemented separate full-update API accepting `BookRequestDTO` with validation via `@Valid`.
- Ensured clients must provide all fields in PUT.
- Confirmed ISBN is included but immutable ‚Äî changes rejected with a clear exception.

### 5. **API Design Recommendation**
- Agreed on supporting both PATCH (partial update) and PUT (full update):
    - PATCH with optional fields, no strict validation for convenience.
    - PUT with full fields, strict validation for completeness.
- Documentation and client guidance to explicitly state which fields are immutable.

### 6. **Testing**
- Completed testing of update scenarios (PUT and PATCH).
- Verified handling of duplicates, missing data, and partial updates.

If you want, we can now prep documentation snippets, or proceed to next module/features like Book deletion, enumeration of lists, or API security configuration. Just let me know your priorities!

Mashallah, great work today! üåüüôèüöÄ
